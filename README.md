# High Performance Stats Models in JAX

A modern statistics package based on JAX, inspired by sklearn, statsmodels and tidymodels

==============================================================

I'd like to build a pure functional stats tools, cuz we can't do anything until we create a complex object in this oop world, which
is sort of annoying

==============================================================

If u're interested in statistics and functional programming or jax, 
we can build stamox together
